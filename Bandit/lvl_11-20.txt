The text in this file has been rotated by 13 positions.
You can use the 'tr' command to do a 'translation' to decode the password.
Rot13 means that A == N, M == Z, Z == M and N == A. The same goes for lowercase
letters.
	cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
The 1st set 'A-Za-z' is what is to be replaced. The 2nd set is how they will be replaced.

	cat data.txt | xxd -r > data
This will pipe the hexdump into the xxd command to reverse and feed into a file called data.
Using file we see that it has been compressed using gzip.
We will now rename it and decompress using 'gzip'.
	mv data data.gz
	gzip -d data.gz
Using file we see that it has been compressed using bzip2. We will do similarly to above
in order to unpack this.
	mv data data.bz2
	bzip2 -d data.bz2
Keep doing this. You will also have instances where you have to unpack using tar.
	tar -xf filename
Keep in mind that in order to unpack the gzip files you need to rename the file so that it
ends in .gz.
